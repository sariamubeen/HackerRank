    Enter your query here and follow these instructions:
    1. Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter 
your query in a single line to avoid error.
    2. The AS keyword causes errors, so follow this convention: "Select 
t.Field From table1 t" instead of "select t.Field From table1 AS t"
