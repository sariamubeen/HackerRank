#You have a test string S.
#Your task is to write a regex which will match S, with following condition(s):

#S consists of tic or tac.
#tic should not be immediate neighbour of itself.
#The first tic must occur only when tac has appeared at least twice before.

$Regex_Pattern = '^(\2tic|(tac))+$';
$Test_String = <STDIN> ;
if($Test_String =~ /$Regex_Pattern/){
